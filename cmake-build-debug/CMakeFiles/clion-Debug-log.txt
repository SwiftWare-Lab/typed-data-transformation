CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/jamalids/Documents/compression-part4/new/big-data-compression/cmake-build-debug/_deps/zstd-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/jamalids/Documents/compression-part4/big-data-compression/cmake-build-debug/_deps/zstd-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
